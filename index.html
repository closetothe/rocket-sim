        <p>This web app was created for my final AERO 485 project at Concordia University
          (Introduction to Space Systems). It does two things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculates remaining unknowns given any set of known rocket quantities.</li>
          <li>Simulates the rocket using <code>matter.js</code></li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is important to note that the physics engine is not completely calibrated.
        The documentation for <code>matter.js</code> is very unclear about what the units mean (for example,
        what does it mean to apply a velocity of '1'?). A scaling factor had to be determined
        experimentally so that the resulting simulation would be in the <strong>ballpark</strong> of
        theoretical calculations.</p>
        <p>The code is available (or will be available) on my github at <a href="https://github.com/closetothe">github.com/closetothe</a>.
        The code is not the easiest to sort through, but it is organized. The Rocket class contains all the information about the rocket
        required for simulation. Parameters are not passed to the Rocket object until they are all defined and the user clicks 'Start'.
        The Rocket object somewhat ties together the rocket properties, <code>p5</code> canvas, and <code>matter.js</code> engine.</p>

        <h2>Variable Completion</h2>

        <p>The hardest part was not the simulation, but calculating unknowns. Because there are <em>many</em> different scenarios that are
        possible, a sequence of conditional statements was completely unfeasible. The solution was to make a general-purpose Property class that holds
        all the information required to solve for a variable. It holds a name (e.g. 'T' for thrust) and any number of sets of independent variables that can be used to
        obtain it. Each set of variables is associated with an equation. When the object is constructed, an anonymous function must be passed for each
        set of independent variables to represent this equation.</p>

        <p>For example, the thrust (\(T\)) property is constructed in the following way</p>
        <ol>
          <li>\[T = f(C_e, \dot{m}) = C_e\dot{m}\] <br>
              <strong>Independent variables:</strong> (\(C_e\),\(\dot{m}\)) <br>
              <strong>Anonymous function</strong> <code>([ce,mdot]) => { return ce*mdot }</code>
          </li>
          <li>\[\Sigma F_x = ma\]
            \[T - m(t)g = m(t)a\]
            \[T - m_fg = m_fa_{max}\]
            \[T = f(m_f, a_{max}) = m_f(a_{max}+g)\]
            <br>
              <strong>Independent variables:</strong> (\(m_f\),\(a_{max}\)) <br>
              <strong>Anonymous function</strong> <code>([mf,amax]) => { return mf*(amax+g) }</code>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>When the user inputs the value of a new variable, the <code>interface.js</code> script goes through each property,
        solving as many as possible. It continues to loop through all properties until it no longer returns any new solutions. It must do this
        because after a single pass-through it may have solved new variables, opening the doors for others to be solved that couldn't be solved before.
        An alternative approach would be to search the independent variables associated with the new input, and only update <em>those</em>,
       but this solution is not as elegant as it sounds. First, some independent variables appear across different equations, resulting in
      immediate duplication. Second, the elegance is completely lost in the amount of extra code required to continue some such process until all
    solutions are found.</p>

      <p>After solving for as many unknowns as possible, the script updates the forms with the new solutions, while also disabling those inputs.
        There are two reasons for disabling the inputs. First, it is easy to differentiate which values were manually inputted and which were solved by the
      computer. Second, it prevents users from tampering with the values and ending up with inconsistent results.</p>

      <p>Finally, there is some extra code that allows the user to delete the most recent input, undoing the solutions that were produced by it. Although this doesn't work
      beyond the most recent input, it is generally possibly to change older values anyway, and the computer will adjust the numbers accordingly.</p>

      <h2>Simulation</h2>
      <p> With all the rocket parameters, simulation is straight-forward. Instead of applying a thrust force, the <code>simulation.js</code> script simply applies \(V(t)\)
        to the body for each time step. Note that the body is approximated internally as a rectangle with the same height and width as the cartoon rocket drawn by the <code>p5.js</code> functions.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Primary Assumptions</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>No drag</li>
          <li>Purely vertical flight</li>
          <li>\(p_e = p_{\infty}\)</li>
          <li>Steady-state mass flow rate</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Equations and Units</h2>
        \[C_e = gI_{sp} = V_e = F/\dot{m}\;\;[m/s]\]
        <p>Where \(g=9.807\;m/s^2\)</p>
        \[T - m_fg = m_fa_{max}\;\;[N]\]
        <p>Note that \(a_{max}\) is in \([m/s^2]\)</p>
        \[\dot{m} = m_p/\;\;[kg/s]\]
        \[m_0 = m_{in} + m_{PL} + m_p\;\;[kg]\]
        \[m_f = m_0 - m_p = m_{in} + m_{PL}\;\;[kg]\]
        \[\text{Mass Ratio} = \text{MR} = m_f/m_i = 1/\text{R}\]
        \[\epsilon = \frac{m_{in}}{m_{p} + m_{in}}\]
        \[\zeta = 1 - \epsilon = \frac{m_{p}}{m_{in} + m_{p}}\]
        \[\lambda = \frac{m_{PL}}{m_{PL} + m_{in}}\]
        \[m(t) = m_0 - \dot{m}t = m_0 - m_p\frac{t}{t_b}\;\;[kg]\]
        \[m(t_b) = m_f\]
        \[V(t) = -C_e\ln{\frac{m(t)}{m_0}} - gt\;\;[m/s]\]
        \[V_b = V(t_b)\]
        \[h_b = -C_et_b\frac{\ln{R}}{R-1} + C_et_b -\frac{1}{2}gt_b^2\;\;[m]\]
        \[h_{max} = h_b + \frac{V_b^2}{2g}\;\;[m]\]

        <h2>Libraries Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>p5.js</li>
          <li>matter.js</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
          <li>Semantic UI</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Small Details</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The solution generator does not allow negative values. There is also some additional 'sanity-checking'. For example, if \(m_{p}\) is 0. </li>
          <li>There is no real reason why I used both 'params' and 'properties' other than convenience. The names are confusing but they don't mean much.
            'params' simply holds the latest set of values, while properties holds all the Property objects for the independent variables. I could have only used the latter, but it
            felt a bit bulky.
          </li>
          <li>The equation-solver only runs when an input box leaves focus (by pressing enter or clicking away). I wanted it to be instant, but it gets stuck and doesn't let you type anymore. You might notice this problem on some inputs that you try to modify.</li>
          <li>I have no idea what the complexity of this program is, since it goes through so many layers, but it is likely a factor of the number of independent variables.</li>
          <li>The solution search prioritizes the simplest equation that could solve for the variable. This is a matter of constructing Properties with the order in mind.</li>
          <li>This app uses JavaScript ES6 syntax pretty liberally. I purposely did not concern myself with browser compatibility (the project was hard enough as it is!) I've tested it on the latest Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</li>
          <li>The entire thing runs much smoother than I expected. Nevertheless, a lot of fat could be skimmed from the memory usage and page-load.</li>
