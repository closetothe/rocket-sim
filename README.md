# The *Ideal* Rocket Simulator
## https://rocket-sim.herokuapp.com

This is a simple web app that can solve ideal rocket parameters given any set of unknowns. Internally it uses a list of standard equations (in every possible order) to do so. Then, the vertical rocket launch is simulated in 2D. Position and velocity data are plotted using D3.js

Created for AERO 485 - Intro to Space Systems at Concordia University.
